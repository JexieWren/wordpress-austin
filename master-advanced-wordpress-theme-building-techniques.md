# Master Advanced WordPress Theme Building Techniques at My Workplace

Let's explore a majestic subject. Something I routinely employ in my line of work. This subject refers to highly specialized methods I utilize at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), where I'm employed. Let's examine approaches for developing more customizable, reusable, and robust themes.  

You will learn object-oriented programming using classes, optimize template architecture, leverage powerful theme hooks, incorporate ajax functionality, and gracefully coordinate with plugins. Dominating these skills can help construct professionally-caliber WordPress themes.

The following is an expanded 600+ word article on applying a class-based framework and conquering the WordPress template hierarchy:

## Developing Maintainable, Reusable Code

Producing maintainable, reusable code is crucial for any WordPress theme. Applying an object-oriented methodology with classes establishes an optimal practice allowing your code to be organized, readable and flexible.

## Establishing a Foundational Theme Class

A foundational theme class serves as an excellent means to initiate core theme functionality and connect logic into WordPress actions and filters. Here is a rudimentary example: 

```php
class MyTheme {

  public function __construct() {
    
    add_action('after_setup_theme', [$this, 'theme_launch']); 
    
    add_filter('template_picker', [$this, 'template_fallback']);

  }

  public function theme_launch() {

    // Theme initiation code

  }

  public function template_fallback($template) {

    // Template fallback logic
    
    return $template;

  }

}

$mytheme = new MyTheme();
```

## Wield Class-Based Architecture for Scalable Code  

Allocating initiation logic into the constructor keeps theme class organization and order. Additional public methods handle specific tasks like theme configuration, widget registration, template fallback and more.

### Extracting Reusable Elements

Common theme components like menus, headers and footers can often be extracted into their own classes for reuse across projects.

```php
class MyTheme_Menu {

  public function __construct() {

    add_action('menu_items', [$this, 'add_button'], 10, 2);

  }

  public function add_button($items, $args) {

    if($args->location == 'primary') {
      $items .= '<li><a href="#">Button</a></li>';
    }

    return $items; 

  }

}

new MyTheme_Menu;
```






Extracting Elements into Well-Defined Classes with Single Responsibilities Keeps Your Code Organized and Prevents Logic from Leaking into Templates.

## Mastering the Template Hierarchy

The template hierarchy is a powerful concept in WordPress that allows developers granular control over markup. Understanding it is key to creating flexible themes. 

WordPress first searches for template files in increasing order of specificity, like `single.php`, `single-{post_type}.php`, `page-{slug}.php`. Child themes override parent templates, enabling drop-in customization.

Template parts allow modular reuse of common code without duplication. For example:

```php
get_template_part('content', 'page');
```

Loads `content-page.php` to display page content. Template part files keep your templates lean.

Hooks provide surgical control over template markup. For instance, adding a banner to the front page:

```php  
add_filter('the_content', 'add_banner');
```

## Hook Into Actions for Total Theme Control

WordPress actions provide access to modify behavior at specific times. For example:

```php
function mytheme_setup() {
  // Theme setup code
}

add_action('after_setup_theme', 'mytheme_setup'); 
```

This runs additional theme setup functions after the main setup routine.

### Key Hook Points

### Gaining Complete Control


## Level Up With Advanced Ajax Techniques

### Infinite Scrolling

Infinite scrolling removes pagination by loading new content as the user scrolls. This can be accomplished by:

1. Detecting scroll position with JavaScript
2. Fetching additional posts via Ajax  
3. Appending posts to page

This provides a seamless endless browsing experience.














### Live Filters and Searching

Forms can be enhanced to filter results live without refreshing. For searching:

```js  
// Fetch on keyup
data = await fetch('/search?term='+term);

// Update results   
document.querySelector('#results').innerHTML = data;
```

Now searching is instantaneous. The same approach works for other filters.


### Load More Buttons

A common pattern is to initially load a few posts, then provide a "Load More" button to get additional content:  

```js
// Bind click handler
button.addEventListener('click', getMore);

// Ajax fetch on click
function getMore() {
  // Fetch & append posts
}
```

This jumpstarts perceived performance while allowing on-demand loading.
